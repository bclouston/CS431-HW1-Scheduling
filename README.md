# COMP-SCI 431 HW1: Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains Java implementations of the Shortest Job First (SJF) and Round-Robin (RR) scheduling algorithms.

- **Shortest Job First**: Non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that prioritizes the process with the smallest execution time in the ready list to execute next.
  
- **Round-Robin**: Preemptive scheduling algorithm that utilizes a queue data structure. Once a process reaches the front of the queue it is executed for one time quantum and then moved to the end of the queue allowing each process to receive an equal share of the CPU.
